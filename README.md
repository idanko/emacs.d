# Emacs dot files

## About
My personal settings I daily use.

Emacs is a highly extensible editor, and it might either help you solve problems
in the fast, agile way or waste your time by hacking elisp code all night
long. I found sticking to the bare minimal vanilla configuration and rely on the
rich built-in system with a few external plugins (without tweaking anything too
much) is the way of using Emacs correctly.

## Configuration
- `straight.el` : package manager: easy download, change and contribute to an interesting plugin; 
- `ivy & counsel` : generic interface;
- `mood-line` : light modeline; 
- `dired` : system navigation;
- `projectile` : project navigation;
- `magit` : git interface (defacto standard);
- `ag`, `isearch` : searching & replacing things;
- `multiple-cursors.el` : changeing chunks of text;
- `org-agenda` : todos and journal;
- `org-roam` : taking and accessing notes;
- `org-drill` : memorizing things;
- `company` : generic completion engine;
- `yasnippet` : code & text snippets;
- `lsp-mode` : code completion;
- `flycheck` : kinda like linter;
- `flyspell` : spell checking;
- `Iosevka Term` font;
- `gruvbox` color theme;
- Few other minor modes;
- Some other major modes for text highlighting.
